# NeuralNetworkProject
 
An attempt at creating a Neural Network without the use of Built in libraries.
Created a digit detection network with high accuracy on the training set.
Accuracy appears to be quite poor for things outside the data set seemingly suggesting the network was overfitted on the data.
Retraining must occur with a larger data set.
